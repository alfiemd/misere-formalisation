        2. Let gr be an arbitrary Right move of g.
        3. Since gr is a Right move of g, we know that gr+1 is a Right move of

        must win gr+1 going first.

        exist some winning move for Left from gr+1.
        6. This winning move is either to gr (by playing on 1), or to some
        grl+1, where grl is a Left move of gr.
        7. Assume first that the winning move is to gr (by playing on 1):
          8. Since this is a winning move for Left (from gr+1), it follows that
          gr must have outcome L or P.
          9. Since g is p-free (h1), we know that gr is p-free.

        11. Assume instead now that the winning move is to some grl+1:
          12. Since this move is winning for Left (from gr+1), we know that
          Right does not win going first on grl+1.
          13. Since grl is p-free (h1), we know that grl is p-free.

        0. Right does not win going first on g+1 (by h2), which means g+1
        cannot be Right end-like.
        1. Since g+1 is not Right end-like, g cannot be Right end-like
        (EndLike_add_iff).
        2. Let gr be an arbitrary Right move of g.
        3. Since gr is a Right move of g, we know that gr+1 is a Right move of
        g+1.
        4. Since Right does not win g+1 going first (by h2), we know that Left
        must win gr+1 going first.
        5. Since 1 is not Left end-like, gr+1 is not Left end-like
        (EndLike_add_iff), so there must exist some winning move for Left from
        gr+1.
        6. This winning move is either to gr (by playing on 1), or to some
        grl+1, where grl is a Left move of gr.
        7. Assume first that the winning move is to gr (by playing on 1):
          8. Since this is a winning move for Left (from gr+1), it follows that
          gr must have outcome L or P.
          9. Since g is p-free (h1), we know that gr is p-free.
          10. So, gr must have outcome L.
        11. Assume instead now that the winning move is to some grl+1:
          12. Since this move is winning for Left (from gr+1), we know that
          Right does not win going first on grl+1.
          13. Since grl is p-free (h1), we know that grl is p-free.
          14. By induction, we must have grl.IsSpecial.

      0. Assume for a contradiction that g+1 has outcome P.

      2. By add_one_P_gives_special, we know that g.IsSpecial.
      3. By SpecialImpliesWin, we know that Right does not win g going first.
      4. We will now show that Left wins g+1 going first.
      5. Left can play on g+1 to g (by playing on 1).
      6. We know that Right does not win g going first, and so Left wins g+1
      going first (by playing on 1 to leave g).
      7. But we assumed that g+1 had outcome P, which means Left does not win
